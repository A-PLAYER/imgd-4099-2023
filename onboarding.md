# Assignment 1 - Onboarding

This assignment counts towards the in-class assignments portion of your grade. Please complete this by the start of class, September 6th.

1. First, check Canvas for an invite to the class Discord server. *All course announcements will be via Discord*. You must sign up ASAP for this server and check it regularly; it will also be a great place to ask questions and receive help. All questions regarding class content should be publicly asked in Discord whenever possible so that your classmates can a) potentially answer your question b) learn from any provided answers. Make sure to follow the onboarding instruction in the Discord server and change your nickname to your preferred first + last name and preferred pronouns.

2. Create a public website for all work completed in the course. The homepage for this website can be extremely minimal (potentially just a list of links along with displaying your name); however, each assignment will generally require you to provide both text and video documentation of your work. Anybody should be able to visit your course website and quickly find this information. Once you have a URL for this website, please make a pull request on the main course website repo adding your link to the websites.md file. The website could be as simple as a github repo with a README; we just want to see references to all your work in one location.

3. Read / experiment with [the Book of Shaders](http://thebookofshaders.com) up through the lesson on [Shapes](https://thebookofshaders.com/07/), with the exception of the chapter "Running Your Shader". NOTE: THIS USES GLSL, NOT WGSL. But it's still one of the best resources out there for learning how to write shaders. Here's [a cheatsheet for converting from GLSL to WGSL](https://github.com/paulgb/wgsl-cheat-sheet)... if you find a better resource for this, please let the class know in Discord! 

4. Read [I want to talk about WebGPU](https://cohost.org/mcc/post/1406157-i-want-to-talk-about-webgpu) to get a better sense of why the API is interesting and potentially even exciting.
